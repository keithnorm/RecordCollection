# Record Collection

This app is mainly 2 things:
- A neat little Spotify app that allows you to save albums to your personal collection.
- An experiment in theming an iOS app using the ideals of CSS.

It was built for a presentation given at Groupon Mobile Tech Talks on 2/26/2014. Slides here: [https://speakerdeck.com/keithnorm/theming-ios-apps-using-css-philosophies](https://speakerdeck.com/keithnorm/theming-ios-apps-using-css-philosophies)

Update! As of 3/18/2014 this app is now up in the app store.
